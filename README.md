## 📖Description 

Hello everyone, I’d like to show you my "To do list" application.

So „To do list" is a web application which allows you to write down any tasks which are necessary (more or less), important (more or less)etc. This list can remind you what you had to do and after all you can simply mark them done or press one button to remove it from list. After update there are 2 more buttons which appear after task list has at least 1 task. First button marks all tasks done and second one hides done tasks.

My web applications contains of 4 buttons which are responsible for:

- ✅ button is responsible for marking tasks you’ve done by adding special text styles. 
- 🗑️ button on red background is responsible for deleting tasks wether it was finished or you don’t want it to be there.
- "Ukryj ukończone" hides all tasks which are marked done.
- "Ukończ wszystkie" allows you to mark all tasks done by one click.

This web APP is a part of my Frontend Dev course in which I participate.
