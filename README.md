## 📖Description 

Hello everyone, I’d like to show you my "To do list" application.

So „To do list" is a web application which allows you to write down any tasks which are necessary (more or less), important (more or less)etc. This list can remind you what you had to do and after all you can simply mark them done or press one button to remove it from list.

My web applications contains of 2 buttons which are responsible for:

- ✅ button is responsible for marking tasks you’ve done by adding special text styles 
- 🗑️ button on red background is responsible for deleting tasks wether it was finished or you don’t want it to be there

This web APP is a part of my Frontend Dev course in which I participate.
